## 🧠 What is DBMS?

A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is software that enables users to **store, manage, retrieve, and manipulate data** efficiently.
It acts as an interface between the **database** and the **end users/applications**.

> DBMS = Data + Database + Management + System

## 📊 Data Hierarchy

The transformation of raw data into decision-making insight follows this hierarchy:

* **Data** – Raw facts and figures
* **Information** – Processed and meaningful data
* **Knowledge** – Understanding derived from information
* **Wisdom** – Ability to make decisions based on knowledge

---

## 🗄️ Database (DB)

A **database** is an organized collection of related data stored in a structured format, typically using **tables**:

* **Rows** → Records
* **Columns** → Attributes

---

## 🔁 DBMS Operations (CRUD)

DBMS supports basic operations on data:

* **Create (Insert)** – Add new records
* **Read (Retrieve)** – Access stored data
* **Update** – Modify existing data
* **Delete** – Remove data

These are commonly known as **CRUD operations**.

## 🏫 Applications of DBMS

DBMS is used in many real-world systems, including:

* Railway and Airline Reservation Systems
* Libraries
* Hospitals
* Universities
* Banking Systems

---

## 💻 Examples of DBMS Software

* **MS Access**
* MySQL
* Oracle
* PostgreSQL
* SQL Server

---

## ✅ Advantages of DBMS

* **Reduced Data Redundancy**
* **Improved Data Consistency**
* **Easy Data Access**
* **Enhanced Data Security**
* **Integrity Constraint Enforcement**

---

## 🔐 ACID Properties

ACID properties ensure **reliable and safe database transactions**:

* **Atomicity** – Transaction is all-or-nothing
* **Consistency** – Database remains in a valid state
* **Isolation** – Concurrent transactions do not affect each other
* **Durability** – Committed data is permanently saved
